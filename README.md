# JSON API for crime.ee

Parses the HTML of crime.ee public player profile pages and turns it into a neat JSON object.

...because I want to learn Ruby & Rails... and NetFly OÃœ should really think about API-first development.

Live API: [http://crime-api.herokuapp.com/](http://crime-api.herokuapp.com/)

N.B! The HTML of the live site might change at any time, this will break the API. The API comes with no guarantees, use at your own risk.
